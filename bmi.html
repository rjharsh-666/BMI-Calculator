    <h1><b>Body Mass Index (BMI)</b></h1>
    <p><i>Body mass index (BMI) is a tool that healthcare providers use to estimate the amount of body fat by using your height and weight measurements. It can help assess risk factors for certain health conditions. The BMI isn’t always an accurate representation of body fatness.</i></p>

            Limitations of using BMI as a screening tool for health conditions
        </h3>
        <p>
            <i>
                The BMI as a screening tool for assessing the risk of certain health conditions, such as Type 2 diabetes and heart disease, has some limitations, including:
            </i> <br><br>
            The BMI doesn’t measure the location or distribution of body fat. This is an issue because excess fat accumulation in certain areas of your body, such as in your belly (abdomen), is associated with a higher risk of health conditions than excess fat accumulation in other areas of your body, such as in your thighs.
            <br><br>
            The relationship between BMI and rate of death often doesn’t account for such factors as family history of diabetes, high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease and high cholesterol (dyslipidemia), familial longevity (average lifespan) or family history of cancer.
